This is the complete and detailed DevOps Three-Tier AWS Architecture and CI/CD Pipeline.
This diagram visually represents the flow of traffic and components across the tiers as follows:
1. UI/Frontend Tier
User Traffic enters through Amazon Route 53 (DNS).
Route 53 directs traffic to Amazon CloudFront (CDN).
CloudFront serves static content from an Amazon S3 bucket, caching assets at the edge for low latency.
2. API/Backend Tier
CloudFront directs API calls (HTTPS) to the Application Load Balancer (ALB).
The ALB distributes traffic across multiple ECS Fargate Tasks running the containerized API within Private Subnets.
Fargate Tasks securely access secrets (like database credentials) from AWS Secrets Manager.
3. Database Tier
The API's Fargate Tasks communicate via the private network to the Amazon RDS Primary Instance (Multi-AZ) for read and write operations.
Read-heavy queries are directed to RDS Read Replicas to offload the primary instance. Both RDS instances reside in Private Subnets for security and utilize Multi-AZ for high av>
4. CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Repository triggers GitHub Actions workflows.
The workflow builds the Docker image and pushes it to Amazon ECR.
The workflow then deploys the API by updating the ECS Service with the new image tag.
It deploys the UI by syncing files to the S3 bucket and triggering a CloudFront Invalidation to clear the old cache.
The pipeline also handles Database Schema Migrations against the RDS instance before deploying the new API version.
